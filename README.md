I found a dataset online relating to GTA V and I thought I would use this as an exercise to practice my skills in data cleaning, analysis and visualization

**_Disclaimer:_**  _These datasets were used ONLY for practicing Tableau Public and Excel_

## Problem Statement

**What are the top 10 most expensive vehicles in Grand Theft Auto V?**

**What kinds of vehicles are in GTA V?**

**What are the slowest vehicles to avoid in Grand Theft Auto V?**

**Any other relevant data insights**

## Skills Demonstrated

The following Tableau skills were incorporated:

Data Sources and Exporting, Dashboards, Advanced Visualizations including:

- Bar chart
- Area chart
- Lollipop chart
- Treemap

## Visualizations

### Number of vehicles

![](https://github.com/MrLanceVance/Lance-GTA-Project/blob/main/Number%20of%20Vehicles%20by%20Year.png)

There are 567 available vehicles in the Grand Theft Auto 5 game

Most of the vehicles were available in 2013 when the game was first released

### Vehicles to avoid 

![](https://github.com/MrLanceVance/Lance-GTA-Project/blob/main/Low%20Speed%20Vehicles.png)

The vehicles above have a top speed of under 50km per hour

The Mammoth Hydra is a military jet and information about its speed was not provided in the dataset

Slow vehicles can affect performance in missions and makes it longer to reach destinations ðŸ˜œ

### Vehicle type 

![]()

Sports cars are the most available vehicles in GTA V

Utility vehicles like tow trucks and golf caddies make up the smallest category


### Dashboard 

![](https://github.com/MrLanceVance/Lance-GTA-Project/blob/main/GTA%20Dashboard.png)

The Inponte Ruiner 2000 is the most expensive car in the Grand Theft Auto game (see image of pink car above)

The slowest vehicles to avoid using in GTA V are the BMX and Cruiser bicycles, the HYV dump trunk and the Rhino tank


## Conclusions/Recommendations

The datasets provide a detailed analysid of the variety of vehicles found in the Grand Theft Auto game

More information about the location of the vehicles would be helpful to players who are attempting to acquire them
